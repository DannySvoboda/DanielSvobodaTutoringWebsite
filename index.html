        Who I Am
      </h2>
      <p>I am a student (class of 2025) at Somerset Berkley Regional High School who is adept in STEM concepts such as programming, math and science. I have volunteered at Somerset Middle School for tutoring as well as gave a presentation to 8th graders for the high school's tech classes. I am also the 2 year president of the Somerset Berkley Cyber Club. I participated in a robotics apprenticeship program at NUWC Newport over the last summer and am very tech oriented, with 1.5 years of experience in python, and basic experience in HTML, including this website.</p>

      <p >I am considering tutoring, ideally at the middle school level. I can be contacted at dannysvo03@gmail.com if you are interested.</p>

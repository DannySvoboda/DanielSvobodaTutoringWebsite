        Who I Am
      </h2>
      <p>I am a student at Somerset Berkley who is adept in STEM concepts such as programming, science and most math. I have volunteered at Somerset Middle School for tutoring as well as giving a presentation to 8th graders for the high school's tech classes. I am also the 2 year president of the Somerset Berkley Cyber Club. I participated in a robotics apprenticeship program at NUWC Newport over the last summer and am very tech oriented, with 1.5 years of experience in python, and basic experience in HTML, including this website.</p>

      <p>I can be contacted at dannysvo03@gmail.com if you are interested in me for tutoring.</p>
